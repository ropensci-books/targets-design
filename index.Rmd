# Introduction {#design}

The [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) package is a [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)-like pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R. With [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets), you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data.

## Design

[`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) has an elaborate structure to support its advanced features while ensuring decent performance. This `bookdown` site is a collection of design documents to explain this architecture, including the data storage model, object oriented design, and orchestration and branching model.
